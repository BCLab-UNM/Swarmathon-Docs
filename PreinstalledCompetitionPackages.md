### Preinstalled Software List

This document contains a list of extra Ubuntu packages that will be installed on the robots at the competition at Kennedy Space Center and on the computers we use for the Virtual Competition.

We cannot provide a complete list of all Ubuntu packages installed (there are hundreds), but you can assume that the packages installed by a default Ubuntu 16.04 x64 Desktop install will be available. We encourage teams to use packages, especially ROS packages that will help you solve the challenge. To add a package to this list modify this document and create a pull request. We will review the changes and test your package on our rovers and computers. We will approve or deny your pull request based on that testing. If a package does not appear on this list and is not part of the default Ubuntu 16.04 x64 Desktop install, it will not be available during the competition.
