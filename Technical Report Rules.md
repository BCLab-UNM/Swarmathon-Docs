### 2017 NASA Swarmathon Technical Report Guidelines

Both Physical and Virtual teams are required to submit a Technical Report electronically via GitHub as a PDF by March 28, 2017 by midnight EST. The paper should be named **Tech_Report_YourSchoolName_2017.pdf** and placed in a folder called **"reports"** in your Github repository.

Judges will score papers based on the technical quality, novelty, significance, and clarity according to the rubric below. The judges' decision is final. The Physical team with the winning Technical Report will receive a team plaque, individual certificates, and a $200 team scholarship. Second and third place winners will receive certificates.

Similarly, the Virtual team with the winning Technical Report will receive a team plaque, individual certificates, and a $200 team scholarship. Second and third place winners will receive certificates.

The report should follow the format of a robotics conference paper. For examples, see the  [Word](http://www.roboticsconference.org/docs/paper-template-word.zip) or [LaTeX](http://www.roboticsconference.org/docs/paper-template-latex.tar.gz) paper templates, as well as the peer-reviewed, published [proceedings](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss08/index.html), for the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference.

These templates serve as suggested guidelines for the Swarmathon technical report, and references should be formatted as they are specified in the templates. Scoring will depend only on the specifications in the rubric.
